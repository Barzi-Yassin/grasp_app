# Grasp Project (in developing)

A Grasp project will be created in flutter using dart programming language. Grasp will supports mobile only android platform till now. Grasp will be useful to save user's daily important points with ana amazing perfomance

## Getting Started

The Grasp contains the minimal implementation required to save user daily information as a grasp point. The repository code is preloaded with some basic screen like basic app folder structure and required fonts to create a new project.

### How Grasp works

- User can create there own subject(as folder), each subject might has many grasp files.
- Inside the grasp files user could add many types of data like text, voice, image, and video as well.


### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides. (it will be expanded in future)

```
grasp-app/
|- android
|- assets
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project. 

```
assets/
|- fonts/
|- images/
```

```
lib/
|- src/screens
```

### Grasp TODOs

TODO: Create screens.
TODO: Create local database to save the the grasp files.
(many other TODOs will added soon!)


### Up-Coming Features:
